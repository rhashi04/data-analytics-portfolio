# data-analytics-portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!
This repository showcases projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, machine learning, and business insights.
I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science & Business Analytics, and I use this space to document projects that highlight my ability to solve problems with data and communicate insights effectively.
